= pyrev: Re:VIEW lint tool written in Python
== "What is this?"

Re:VIEW lint tool with Python.

== "Does this replace Re:VIEW tool written in Ruby?"

No. Absolutely no.

There's no plan to let this tool output some actual files
like pdf, epub, etc.

As I said first, this just checks input.

== "Then, ...what is this?"

This is part of my project which makes use of Re:VIEW.
The tool itself is written in Python and currently not open to everyone.

I found some of utility in the project is still useful enough even though
the tool is half-baken.


== "Well, I'm not sure what you're saying."

Sorry for my poor explanation.

Basically, most of folks reading this should NOT touch this project
at this point.. Just cling to the original Re:VIEW tool written in Ruby.

I'm working hard to make things done. Please stay tuned.

== "Can I contribute? :-)"

Yes welcome. Basically. Possibly. Maybe.

But there's one thing you should be careful.
This tool is very VERY immature right now.

I have already noticed several design flows (not bugs) I should fix.
You'll be easily trapped by the change instead of actually (kindly)
contributing the project.

Shamefully, I need to say that,
I do not recommend you contribute at this moment.
I promise I'll just make things clearer.
